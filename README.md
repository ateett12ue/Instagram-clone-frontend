## Available Project (Version 1)
This is a basic instagram project created on MERN Stack, context apis and materialize css with func likes - 
#### sign in/ sign up
#### view, comment, like post
#### follow and unfollow users
#### upload posts
#### send email creation link for reset password as well as account creation
#### View others profile
#### Search user 

This project was a rougue version to try what I learned as for MERN stack developer in pass 6 months, creating this project required 24 hrs, but I did it after work, when time allows so I was only applying one funct in a day.


## Next Update for the Project (Version 1)
This is will be a work to showcase what I really learn from propelld, will  be taking atomic approach to  redisgn instagram design in front end, will add proper async approach in api development side, will add proper response structure for apis and the best part will be the use of Redux in place of context api - 
#### sign in / sign up similar to Instagram original design
#### Skeleton mode for data rendering
#### modal development for post viewing
#### upload posts with custom view and crop functionality
#### introducing hastags 
#### searching users with names and hastags
#### Proper ux improvements
#### Proper folders layering in backend side
#### Design pattern explanation
#### UI/UX of instagram explanation

This project would be the final version for MERN stack and redux development, Will work on this as of hackathone, waiting for less work load, to complete this.
